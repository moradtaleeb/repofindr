# RepoFindr
A simple app that let you search for git repos, and filter them either on best matches, forks or stars.

## Technologies
- Nodejs 10.x
- Expressjs 4.x
- npm 6.x
- jQuery 1.8.x
- Jade view engine
- Semantic UI
- GitHub API v3
- Supertest
  - Choose it because it provides high level testing for http and expressjs routes
  - This could be integrated with other testing packages (like mocha) for better testing 

## Challenges
- Most of the technologies/tools used are new to me, the challenge was to learn them and code/deliver fast
- Getting repo owner info (followers and follwing counts) isn't something that you can get straightforwardly
